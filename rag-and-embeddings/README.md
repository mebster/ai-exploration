# Exploring Embeddings with a naive RAG implementation

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a natural language processing (NLP) model architecture that combines the powers of two major components: a retriever and a generator. This approach aims to enhance the generation of human-like text by incorporating relevant information retrieved from a large dataset or corpus. The RAG model architecture is particularly useful in tasks like question answering, fact verification, and content creation where the integration of external knowledge can significantly improve the quality and relevance of the generated text.

This experiment expects that you have installed Ollama locally.

You will also need to convert a Word document (e.g. doc.docx) into a doc.pdf file. This is where the chunks will be created from.
